            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And their late Statutes made for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and alleadging, that if they ſhould be hanged, none would be

And thereby feaſting their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and their Impes upon the faſt of their finders, and thriving in their wickedneſs till God rebuke them. The Warden of the Fleet I find by Law is no Goaler within the Statute of <hi>H.</hi> 6. And by experience a Gentleman merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and affable to the poor, ſatiable and unburthenſom to the Rich, compaſſionate, and comfortable to all his priſoners, ſo that (by Gods providence and his clemency,) he and we live wholſom in our bodies, and cheerfull in our hopes. I write not this digreſſion in flattery; but in duty to declare truth as I find it. So returning to my tenet, it is the ſickneſs and death of the Souls and bodies of all their Clyents and their Families, (except thoſe of their<pb n="23" facs="tcp:56877:18"/>Conſorts) that the Art of our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Lawyers practiſeth upon, And if perchance they eaſe a Rich clyent of ſome part of his pain for their own extracrdinary gain (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept their deed be taken for their will) they ſhall hardly obtain hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by their merit. Theſe are the inſtigations of the Devil, &amp; indeavours of bad Lawyers. It is the health of their patients ſouls and bodies that the art of Phyſitians worketh upon. And although ſome Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, that have not the art, Intrude into the profeſſion, and kill more than they cure for want of ſkill, not good will, their will being taken for their deed pleads more in mercy than Lawyers miſpriſions.</p>

<hi>Theode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctes</hi> a famous Philoſopher, Cited by <hi>Stobaeus</hi> in his
66. Sermon, That all men endowed with natural abillities deſire 2 things before they have them, which many when they have them, deſire to be rid of. That is to ſay old age and wives. <hi>Cicero</hi> upon <hi>Cato Major</hi> maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the ſame in effect. The cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of theſe 2 deſires are twofould. That is to ſay in good men for<pb n="24" facs="tcp:56877:18"/>divine ends, In bad men for their worldly pleaſures, Their <hi>ſummum bonum,</hi> beyond which they have neither hopes nor deſires: But for the deſires of good men to be old men, <hi>Ambroſe Hex</hi> lib 1. ſaith, that although old age, in moſt men, is moſt ſubject to corporal Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, It ſooner endeth the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of this life, and openeth the gates to a happier. In good man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners it is moſt decent, In Counſel moſt ſubtile, in conſtancy to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace death moſt ſtable, in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing luſts moſt ſtrong, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally the Infirmitie of the body, is the ſobriety of the mind.</p>
            <p>In bad men their deſire of old age is to prolong their earthly pleaſures in their enjoyment of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens Rights, which they poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs by force, or fraud or both, and famiſhing the Right heirs in dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons, while they pamper their own bodies and their Impes in their ſumptuos Pallaces, built up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their priſoners Inheritances. Living in which Condition we may obſerve them in their health ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, in their ſickneſs timorous, and Commonly diſtracted, in their<pb n="25" facs="tcp:56877:19"/>deaths deſperate, in manners rio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, in counſel wicked, in luſts inſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiable, finally the ſtrength of their bodie is the madneſs of their minds. And are not theſe the true Characters of our Lawyers and their adherents. To the next point, good men love to meet with good Wives, like <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Rebecca,</hi> to be their Conſorts, Comforts and helpers in goodneſs, to propagate
<hi>Saints</hi> as well by their examples of life and Converſation, as by their naturall endowments to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh the end of their Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that is to ſay, to fullfill the number of the elect, to inherit the Kingdom of Heaven by the merits of their Saviour. And in the time of their pilgrimage, and way thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to indeavour the Increaſe of the glory of God, and the Peace, Love, and Unity, of his people in this world. Bad men deſire weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy wanton mercenary Wives, to be their Companions and helpers in miſchiefs, as
<hi>Iſabel</hi> was <hi>Achabs.</hi> To incarnate and multiply De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils as well by their examples of life and Converſation, as by their natural endowments to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh<pb n="26" facs="tcp:56877:19"/>the end of their miſcreancie. Briefly to cooperate with them in all endeavours to increaſe the deluſions and dominion of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, and the ſedition, hatred and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of this world. So that at laſt they muſt as brothers in Iniquity, with
<hi>Antichriſt,</hi> become poſſeſſed of hell, where there is endleſs ſorrow and gnaſhing of teeth, a place provided for them before the world began, from which God deliver us: But are not theſe alſo true characters of our Lawyers?</p>
            <p>Popes, that have thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as omnipotent as Common Lawyers, never offered to divorce men from their Wives, but where they Judged the marriage unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for ſome Reaſon, or pretence of Reaſon in their Laws. But our Lawyers and their Goalors <hi>&amp;c</hi> by fetching men from the Remoteſt parts of <hi>England</hi> to <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and Committing and detaining of them for debts, or moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly for ſuppoſed debts or treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes without any colour of Law, while their adverſaries (moſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently Lawyers Attorneys) <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate, ſollicite, and at laſt, by<pb n="27" facs="tcp:56877:20"/>their diligence, lies, falſe meſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges from their huſbands, and other diabolicall practiſes, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come their feminine frailties, and make them their Whores, get their conſents to poſſeſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of all their huſbands eſtates, reall and perſonall, conſume part of the perſonall to feaſt their Whores at the lower end of their tables, where their own Wives ſit at the upper, and their families be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween. While they contrive Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyances with fines and procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations to aſſure their priſoners Reall eſtates to themſelves and their heirs, to which their bewitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Whores give way, and their Impriſoned huſbands never hear of the matter till too late to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medied by our Lawyers Law. Is not this more and worſe than a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh divice: Others they fetch from nearer parts Priſoners to their Marſhallſeas, ſuffer their Wives to boord and bed with them untill they have ſould beds and all, and then failing to ſatisfie extortions, their huſbands are dungened and their Wives caſt &amp; kept out in the ſtreet, except yielding to the luſt<pb n="28" facs="tcp:56877:20"/>of a turn-key, ſuch as he liketh, be let in to ſerve his turn and after turned again to the reſt in the ſtreet, where often they and their children ſtarve, not daring when they find any ſcraps to aneer their huſbands and parents, to relieve them with any till all be ſtarved. In ſtreets and dungeons Huſbands Wives and Children. Creditors look after your debts, what might have payed you part, if nor all in time, had you taken a lawfull Courſe, Goalers and their partners have parted in fees, uſurer dye with grief, not for the loſs of thy debters but the debt and boaſt of thy Revenge, thou haſt dice of his bones. Is not this more and worſe than the Popes divorce, yet more and worſe then this, Judges and Goalers do in diverting and reſtraining the Saints of God from his ſervice, and hearing of his word preached, by which faith commeth and is maintained, ſo farr as in them lieth, except when in malice to ſome Orthodox miniſter, not love to the priſoners they caſt him amongſt them, not to the end to better them, but to worſe himſelf.</p>

If the miſchiefs, and inconveniencies of the Realm were great before the ſaid Acts were made to declare the Laws of the land, which formerly the lawyers reſerved to themſelves, till then undeclared?

29<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of this Act, <hi>viz. No Free man</hi> &amp;c. And for his Eſtate, as much as the proverb ſaith; <hi>Where nothing is to be had, the King looſeth his due.</hi> If the King did not remit ſo much by this Act, then did he gain thereby more than he gave, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the opinion of all Lawyers, that ſay, All Acts of Parliament are to be expounded for the benefit of the Subject. And what, and how did he gain? but contrary to his Honour, much more to his Grace, when two more of his ſubjects were hedged in<pb n="6" facs="tcp:56877:30"/>by this Act, as Pledges to pay for his undone Debtor, and to undoe themſelves and their families by the bargain. And (their eſtates being too little to pay their own debts) their Creditours muſt ſee the King firſt ſerved out of the ſame, to their no ſmall prejudice, if not undoing, where by many are injured through one mans occaſion. If therefore this Act ought to be conſtrued for the honour of the King, and benefit of the ſubject (as I believe it ought, and the L. <hi>C.</hi> ſaith, others have thought ſo) it followeth, That the Statute of the 33. <hi>Hen.</hi> 8.9. was made (as many more were before and ſince) againſt <hi>Mag.

Shall they, that commit Debtors into their Marſhals cuſtodie, upon ſuch judgements by their priviledge (as they call it,) ſay that this Statute doth not take away ſuch priviledges, when the Lo. <hi>C.</hi> himſelf ſaith, that all Statutes ought to be expounded ſo, that there ſhould be no failer of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice; and this Statute, being <hi>M. Ch.</hi> (chief of all Statutes) and all its Confirmations ſay, that equal juſtice ought to be done to all men, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out regard of perſons? What Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute or cuſtom did, or can give any priviledge to any Court to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie? What benefit of priviledge<pb n="17" facs="tcp:56877:36"/>hath the Debtor, that is ſo commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by this Court, and its priviledge, but his undoing, and his families, and often his untimely death by famin, and miſerie? Is not that ſo occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned by the rigour, and illegalitie of this Court, an offence of the higheſt nature, of Murther and Perjurie? Who gaineth any thing by this pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge, but the Court, and their Marſhal in extorted Fees, to the dammage of both Creditor and Debtor, and often the ruin ob both or either? Why therefore doth the L. <hi>C.</hi> call it priviledge to the party in Cuſtodie, when it appeareth to be no benefit, but prejudice unto him, and that more aggravated, to have more Actions laid upon him for more debts occaſioned (perhaps) by his impriſonment? What law, or reaſon requireth any priviledge to any man for debt, ſince this Statute in the 29 chapter, freeth all mens bodies from impriſonment, untill they be lawfully tried by their Peers? and no law, but an abortive Statute made 25.
<hi>Ed.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 17. and repealed in the 42 of the ſame King (as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid) gave an Arreſt againſt Debtors but Merchants and Accomptants?
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:56877:37"/>and a Statute made in the ſaid 25 year of the ſaid King, gave the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors two parts of all their Debtors lands, &amp; all their goods (except the beaſts of their plough) for ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of their debts, which Statute is ſtill in force, and daily executed accordingly? As for Accomptants, Debtors, and Tennants to the King, that are ſo indeed, if the Court of <hi>Exchequer</hi> be thought proper for them; why ſhould others that are not ſuch indeed, be ſheltered to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend or countenanced to offend un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that pretence? And as for Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of any Court, why ought not they to ſue, and be ſued by their At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turneys in other Courts than their own, ſince it is unnatural for any bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to ſuffer any of its Members (though never ſo corrupt) to be put to any ſmart, which it may avoid? And may not, nay ought not every juſt Court avoid ſuch ſuits, and the ſuſpition of their injuſtice by enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining them, and proceeding there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, by leaving them to the juſtice of other Courts of competent judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as all other Courts do leave their Members to the mercy of the Courts at
<hi>Weſtminſter?</hi>
                     <pb n="19" facs="tcp:56877:37"/>or may not, nay ought not all Courts of judicature within their juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, determine the cauſes of all ſuch Members of the Courts at <hi>Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> as ſhall be found, and arreſted within their juriſdictions, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding any Writs of priviledge, or other Writs to remove them, before they be determined; rather than the Courts at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> may ſend for the Members of every Court, to be juſtified by them? For who can ſay, he hath ever found any juſtice there againſt any priviledged man? And how many that be no Members of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Court there indeed, are ſo coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced, as ſubordinate to ſome ill Member, or other there, and have their Law for nothing, to bring Fees and gain to one or other of thoſe Courts, out of honeſt mens purſes and Eſtates, againſt whom they can ſhew no colour of right any where, but where they know they ſhall be favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and their Adverſaries oppreſſed? And how many men of good Eſtates have been, and daily are, not onely oppreſſed, but undone by that means? Thirdly, for Treſpaſs,
<hi>vi &amp; Armis;</hi> Is it but a Common-Plea, and conſequently proper to all<pb n="20" facs="tcp:56877:38"/>courts of Record, and rather to be tryed within that juriſdiction where the offence is committed, than elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where? And hath not the King his Fines impoſed and levyed by the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of all ſuch courts, as wel as by the <hi>Kings-Bench?</hi> Fourthly, for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plevins, may they not as well be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved to, and determined by the <hi>Common-Pleas,</hi> as in the
<hi>Kings-Bench?</hi> Fifthly, what meaneth the Lord by his words, <hi>viz.
[Originally reſtrained]</hi> but that the <hi>Kings-Bench</hi> is reſtrained from having any origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Writs Returnable thither in
<hi>Real</hi> Pleas,? And is it not as much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained from originals in
<hi>Perſonal Pleas,</hi> that are as <hi>Common-Pleas,</hi> as <hi>Real,</hi> by this Statute? Or by what other Statute, Law, or Preſident, is it inabled to have any originals re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnable to it for debt, when the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſter and
<hi>Ret. brevium</hi> have no ſuch Preſidents, as aforeſaid? Is not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all the practice of the <hi>Kings-Bench</hi> for debt, unjuſt, and perju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, as aforeſaid? and moreover a faint Action, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as the priſoners for debt in that Court have lately ſet forth by their Petition to the Lord General, and his Officers concerning this matter.</p>

Are men lawfully Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawed upon any Exigents, that are Outlawed without the judgement of the Coroners of the Countie where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they are Outlawed? Are the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roners of any Countie now adays, preſent at every, or any Countie, when, and where men are Outlawed?

How many are fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther damnified by ſuch Outlawries, procured of purpoſe, to debar them of their juſt ſuits in all Courts, until they reverſe them? How chargeable are reverſals thereof?

<hi>Middleſex,</hi> but they muſt alſo have the like Returns of their Exigents throughout the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom? Are not ſuch Returns falſe, and perjurious in the Sheriffs that make them? Is it not ſufficient for Judges, to perjure themſelves, but that they<pb n="39" facs="tcp:56877:48"/>muſt animate others to do ſo too, by not puniſhing them, when they know that practiſe? Are not the Sheriffs of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Middleſex,</hi> and all the Coroners of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom made liable by this practiſe to Actions of the Caſe, and to pay coſts and dammages to the parties grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved? Are ſuch Judges, Lawyers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for the Peace, or Profit of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, that beget, foment, or ſuffer the cauſes of ſuch Actions, cauſeleſly, but for their own ends and gains? Are ſuch Courts to be called, or counted Courts of Juſtice, that maintain any Actions, or Arreſts upon unjuſt grounds, or colour of any miſ-begotten Laws, contrarie to

Are not many mens lives loſt, and more hazzarded, and their eſtates ruined thereby? And if a Catch-poll be killed for making, or attempting ſuch unlawfull Arreſt, do not the Judges uſe to adjudge it wilful Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, though the wronged party doth but endeavour his juſtifiable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence? And have they not begotten a Statute for officers to plead the<pb n="40" facs="tcp:56877:49"/>General iſſue, by colour of which they juſtifie themſelves, and their creatures, and condemn the guilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs? Are not the cauſers of Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as worthy to be hanged, as the doers? Are not they that maintain ſuch Arreſts, to the ſame ends as their Predeceſſors, Imps of the ſame ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration? Why therefore their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice deſired, or received in ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters? Are not the Releaſes of Errors, which Priſoners are forced to ſeal before they can be inlarged, rather proofs of their guiltineſs, than ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quittances of ſuch practitioners? Are not their Errors manifeſt to be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and gainfull onely to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and hurtfull to the Common-wealth? are ſuch Errors, or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, to be called Due courſes, or Proces of Law? Then (to ſpeak once for all) is not the Due courſe, and Proces of Law obſtructed, and perverted? and a wrong courſe pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed, full of Errors, Lies, Forgeries, Perjuries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (as alreadie appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and better ſhall hereafter) and cannot Law be executed without ſuch practiſes? Doth not
<hi>Mag. Char.</hi> and all its confirmations, ſhew how it may? Are not they ſufficient lights,<pb n="41" facs="tcp:56877:49"/>and guids for the Due courſe, Proces, and Proceedings which ought to be obſerved, in the right execution of Law? And doth not the Lord <hi>Coke</hi> confeſs them to be ſuch, and that they never miſguided any man, that certainly knew them, and truly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed them? Fol. 526. Fourthly, <hi>If no man ſhall be exiled,</hi> &amp;c. Are not Debtors exiled from their Native Soils in <hi>Cumberland,</hi> or
<hi>Cornwal,</hi> and from all their wordly comforts, of Wifes, Children, Families, Friends, and Eſtates, both Real, and Perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal when called, and forced by <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beas corpus</hi> &amp;c. to attend Duke <hi>Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey</hi> in
<hi>Pauls,</hi> or Judge <hi>Owen</hi> in <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter</hi> (as good dead as any Judges living) to hear or diſpatch Suits by the Law of the Land in any way of Juſtice, while the Suitors money laſts; or to relieve them with any Alms, when their Purſes are ſpent? And if at laſt ſent to the
<hi>Fleet,</hi> or <hi>Marſhalſey,</hi> where they be pent up as aforeſaid; are they not worſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iled than into <hi>Turkie,</hi> where they may have more Liberty of Land and Sea, and live in leſs Slavery than un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Goalers in <hi>England,</hi> and have more hopes to return home again
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:56877:50"/>(like Sir <hi>Thomas Shirley,</hi> and many others) than from theſe Hells, whence few find Redemption? Had <hi>Henry</hi> of
<hi>Bullingbrook</hi> been Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for Debt here, (as ſuch now are) when he was baniſhed to <hi>France</hi> could he have hoped to be King of
<hi>England,</hi> except he had made all his Judges, and Goalers, the beſt ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of all his Uſurpations, as all the cheating Priſoners in theſe places do theirs, as they and their Creditors can beſt tell, by dear, and daily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience? Fifthly, <hi>If no man ſhall be deſtroyed,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>unleſs by Verdict,</hi> &amp;c. Are not all Priſoners for Debt, who are firſt forced themſelves to deſtroy their ſmall Eſtates to buy bread to eat in Idleneſs, and to pay Fees to Goalers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and at laſt to Famiſh in the <hi>Fleet,</hi> or <hi>Marſhalſey,</hi> &amp;c. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed both in Lives, and Eſtates, and their Families to boot, without any Verdict given, or intended for their Lives? Nay are not all the Free-men of
<hi>England,</hi> that are, or may be ſubject to Debts, conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſubject to the like deſtruction? And worthy ſo long as they ſuffer the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> (contained in the glorious Fabrick of the

                     <hi>of the Liberties of</hi> England, built by their Anceſtors for a perpetual Monument of ther care of their Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity, and their Liberties for ever) to be thus deſtroyed by an Hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Generation of Phariſaical Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders to the onely knowledge of theſe Laws, which by that pretence, they thus pervert, to deſtroy all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt men whom it ſhould ſave, and to ſave all whom it ſhould deſtroy or puniſh; and that for unlawful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, and conſiderations tending onely to their own profits, and ends. Sixthly, <hi>If no man ſhall be condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but by the judgement of his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quals according to the Laws of the Land;</hi> Are not all Debtors that are Famiſhed as aforeſaid, Condemned for their Lives in effect, though but for their Debts in appearance, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Verdict of their equals, ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, contrary to the Law of the Land? Seventhly, do not all the Judges at
<hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> ſell Juſtice, when they ſell Priſoners for Debt, their Writs of <hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi> &amp;c. for money, when the King would have all his Writs of Grace to be given to his Subjects <hi>Gratis,</hi> and no Judge to take any Fee, or Reward for any<pb n="44" facs="tcp:56877:51"/>thing but of himſelf? Eightly, Do they not deny Juſtice when they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch Writs
<hi>Gratis?</hi> Ninthly, Do they not defer Juſtice, when they detain poor men that are Bailable in Priſon, while they have ſufficient men ready to tender for their Bail, till they be forced to borrow money of other friends, and to ſend far, and ſtay long before they can receive it to looſe their Bail in the interim, and be forced to ſeek others; by which delays, their Goalers Fees increaſe, and their Dyer, Lodging, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences draw charges, which they might have ſaved to find Bread for their Wives and Children at home; who perhaps are forced to faſt by that means, and to ſell, or pawn their Cows, or Clothes for this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, this damnable money, thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted by a Judge, for ſcribling his Infamous name to a Writ, which doth but wrap a man, and his cauſe, faſter in his clouches? O Mercileſs, Miſerable, Mercinary Judge! that can neither give, nor lend ſo little as his name, to ſo much goodneſs in Policie, (if not in Charity) to give a man Liberty to breath, and take leave of his Home, upon ſecurity of<pb n="45" facs="tcp:56877:51"/>more advantage both to Court, and Party, than his impriſonment to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to his Pinfold. <hi>Radamanth</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf abhorreth ſuch fooliſh covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Do they not defer Juſtice, when by their Writs they cauſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictments, Informations, and juſt Suits Commenced in other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent, and more proper Courts in all parts of the Kingdom, to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved to <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and there de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained without any Tryal theſe 40 years? How many thouſands of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, and heinous Malefactors that ſhould have been puniſhed in, and by their Counties, and Courts at home, have by this means found <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and its Courts, their onely Sanctuaries, and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges for none but Eminent, Opulent, Impenitent Offendours? But is not Juſtice denyed, when any Bailable man is denyed to be Bail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? Or more, when Bail is accepted upon Oath for its ſufficiency, and is denyed to be Filed, and the Party ſo Bailed in Law, detained Priſoner ſtill, at the Judges, and Plantiffs pleaſures? Briefly, Is not the Adminiſtration of all the Law, and Juſtice in <hi>England,</hi> Ingroſſed and<pb n="46" facs="tcp:56877:52"/>Monopolized at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> where the Judges and Courts aſſume to be chief, and do exerciſe a plenary ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction over all others, ſo that they ſuffer none but themſelves to erre, or to abuſe Law; nor any to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh any Juſtice, or to reform any Errors, but onely themſelves, who do pretend to correct all in their <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>checquer-Chamber,</hi> where inſtead of correcting any, they confirm their own; which muſt be all as aforeſaid. Laſtly, is it unknown that they were wont to Buy their Offices of the Kings Servants, and therefore to Sell their Under-Offices to their own Servants, Attorneys, <hi>&amp;c?</hi> And was not this the Buying and Selling of Juſtice that is yet unpaid for, &amp; had need to be Reformed? Is it any reaſon that any ſhould Buy Juſtice, and not Sell it for gain by the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain? Is it not Bought to that end? Is it not to that end, Judges neglect to give Attorneys their ancient Oath, whereby they were wont to be Sworn to do no Falſhood, nor cauſe any to be done in their Courts; and if they knew any, to give know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge thereof to the Judges, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that they ſhould increaſe no Fees,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> (as<pb n="47" facs="tcp:56877:52"/>you may read it at large in the latter end of the <hi>Attorneys Academy.</hi> Is it not to the ſame end that Judges neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect to give all Plantiffs for Debts or Treſpaſs, their Oaths that the Debt or Treſpaſs amounteth to 40

Had Lords any more Law, Right, or Reaſon, to Sequeſter, and puniſh their villains at their own Wills, but for that their villains did take their Lands upon conditions to do thoſe ſervices which they and their Lords agreed upon, and gave their Lords their Oaths (as their greateſt bonds) to perform thoſe conditions, or in caſe of breach, to ſuffer their Lords to repoſſeſs their Lands, with the<pb n="90" facs="tcp:56877:74"/>forfeitures of their Goods, (which they gained) and their Lives (which they ſuſtained) upon the ſame?

Is not this Oath a ſufficient Evidence in it ſelf, that the takers of it, have, &amp; do dayly break it? &amp; cauſe all others that have, or do break it, to do ſo likewiſe?

Did our late Judges lawfully counſel King <hi>Charls</hi> in his buſines, when they gave their Reſolutions for him concerning the Ship-money?

Did not the Kings Councel and other Serjeants, and Lawyers, draw (if not plot) all ſuch Patents? Got they not more by their Fees, for their adviſe therein, (which were preſent pay) than the King did by his reſervations for intereſt in<pb n="93" facs="tcp:56877:75"/>thoſe Grants which are yet in Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rear?

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:56877:98"/>for the ordering of Maſters, as well as ſervants?

Moreover, the chief Juſtice of this Court ought to be but the Kings de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putie by writ; and no King in<pb n="21" facs="tcp:56877:120"/>being, no ſuch Deputy can be. <hi>Hugh de Burgo</hi> Earl of <hi>Kent,</hi> chief Juſtice under King <hi>Henry</hi> the third, took his oath with his Maſter, to obſerve and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tein <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and ſoon after perſuading the King to break it, became the firſt Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurer of his place in that point; as the Lord <hi>Cook</hi> upon

And few or no Laws beſides <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and it's confirmations, will ſerve to do that without thoſe ſuperfluous number of volums which Lawyers have contrived for their own <hi>Reports of Caſes,</hi> and crafty diſputes, arguments, and cavils paſs'd among them; but to be uſed by ſuch as have minde and leiſure to reade them, as Divines may the Works of the wantoneſt Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets, to pick out their flowers for their Pulpits, and leave their ſcurrilities to others of their Autor's <hi>genius.</hi> Or as Interludes,

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:56877:127"/>the commiſſions of the peace and charters of corporations can prove and warrant.

                  <p>The ſparing of all theſe courts, and the charge thereof amounting to, if not ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounting three millions <hi>per annum,</hi> and the confirmation of <hi>Mag.

                  <p>And being come to ſpeak of antient cuſtoms to be reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and modern to be aboliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I cannot chuſe but remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the

                  <p>And that therefore the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Reformation would be manifeſted in the works of Charitie; and if ſuch as have griped the patrimony of the Church into their claws, can finde in their hearts to reſtore to the poor no part of that <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt</hi> which all the ſaid Statutes and manie more, and all the writings of the Fathers, and many of our own modern Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops (who unjuſtly detained<pb n="44" facs="tcp:56877:132"/>all they could from them) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly confeſs and teſtifie they ought to have in all Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall poſſeſſions, not as the Alms of the Incumbents, but as their own rights by the expreſs wills and donations of the Primitive Founders of Churches, Hoſpitals, &amp;c. and other devout Donors, and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactors to ſuch places from time to time ſo exceſſively bountifull to the Clergie and Corporations for the poors ſake, that the Statutes of Mort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main were made to reſtrain them.</p>

                                 <pb n="76" facs="tcp:56877:148"/>This is ſo prejudicial unto me, that I am forced to end this Seſsion ſome few hours before I meant it, being wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling not to receive any more Remonſtrances, to whieh I I muſt give a harſh anſwer.</p>
                              <p>And ſince I ſee that even the Houſ of Commons begins already to make falſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions of what I granted in your Petition, leſt it be worſe interpreted in the Countrey, I will now make a Declaration concerning the true intent thereof.</p>
                              <p>There Profeſsion of both Houſes, in the time of ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mering this Petition, was no waies to trench upon my Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:56877:148"/>ſaying, They had neither intention nor power to hurt it.</p>
                              <p>Therefore it muſt needs be conceived, that I have grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no new, but only confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ancient Liberties of my Subjects: Yet to ſhew the cleerneſs of my intentions; that I neither repent, nor mean to recede from any thing I have promiſed you, I do here declare, That thoſe things which have been don, whereby men had ſome cauſe to ſuſpect the Liberty of the Subjects to be trencht upon (which indeed was the firſt and true gound of the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition) ſhall not here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after be drawn into Example
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:56877:149"/>for your prejudice: And in time to come (in the word of a King) you ſhall not have the like cauſe to complain.</p>
                              <p>But as for Tonnage and Poundage, It is a thing I cannot want, and was never intended by you to ask, never meant (I am ſure) by me to grant.</p>
                              <p>To conclude, I command you all that are here, to take notice of what I have ſpoken at this time, to be the true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and meaning of what I granted you in your Petition: But eſpecially you, my Lords, the Iudges, for to you onely, under me, belongs the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of Laws; for none <pb n="79" facs="tcp:56877:149"/>of the Houſes of Parliament, joynt or ſeparate, (what new doctrine ſoever may be rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed) have any power, either to make or declare a Law without my conſent.</p>

<hi>England,</hi> reſerving ſo much of their ancient ordinary Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction to free men, that none but ſuch may be Iurors, and none but ſuch may be their Iudges for their lives, lands, and eſtates: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as the Keepers of our Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties are ſubordinate to the Parliament, ſo are their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſaries to them, and both in their Iudgments, to the verdicts of the Iurors, which is their true ſaying of the whole matter, as well for Law, as Fact; and ſo is the full Iudgment of it, both in<pb n="35" facs="tcp:56877:180"/>Law and effect, wanting onely the aſſent of the Soveraign Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction, which is the onely party ſuppoſed to be againſt the party guiltie, or ſo repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and hath that Majeſtie (or if well conſidered, that vaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage) given unto it, as to do, or command to be don Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution; which, if the hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man refuſe upon the Sheriffs command, the Sheriff him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf muſt doe; and if he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe, or neglect, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſarie Iudge muſt, for as there is a Writ <hi>de procedendo ad judicium,</hi> and an <hi>Alias, plures;</hi> and Attachment to compell him to give his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or, more properly, his aſſent (as aforeſaid) to the Juries verdict: So that if he delay, denie, or faile to do,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:56877:181"/>or cauſe Execution to be don, there is another Writ
<hi>de exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutione Judicii,</hi> and an <hi>Alias, Plur',</hi> and Attachment upon that, to be had againſt him; whereupon, if a Commiſſary Iudg muſt be Attached for not giving his aſſent, (com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called his Iudgment) to a verdict for Fellonie, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or having given his Iudgement to the verdict, ſhall denie or delay execution, except in ſpecial things hereafter touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, let him not onely be an hangman for his Fellows, but be hanged himſelf; for ſuch was King <hi>Alfreds</hi> Iudgment in all Caſes of injuſtice in his Commiſſary Iuſtices, as you may read in the
<hi>Mirror</hi> from <hi>p.</hi> 239. to <hi>p.</hi> 245. when he hanged 44 of them in one<pb n="37" facs="tcp:56877:181"/>year. But it is obſervable how Commiſſary Judges for Gaol deliveries do now a dayes uſe in the concluſion of their judgments upon Fellons; convicted by Iuries verdicts, and their aſſents, to command Sheriffs to ſee execution, and ſo to end their Seſſions; and get themſelvs gon out of that County with all expedition, and let the Sheriff and his hangman agree as they can bargain, for doing the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, while the Commiſſary impoſter proceedeth in his Circuit, attributing all that he findeth the people conceiv to be injuſtice, to the Sheriff, or Iury, or both, but calling all judgments and proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings (that are pleaſing to the people throughout his peram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation<pb n="38" facs="tcp:56877:182"/>and the Ambit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, even the Cirquit it ſelf,) his own; becauſe the people aſſented to ſuch Commiſſions, as the devill doth the world his own, becauſe God gave him leave to compaſs it; And as proud are ſuch Lords juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of their Lordſhips in a kinde, as he can be of his; yet in right ought to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted but ſervants to their Maſters, as he to his. And therefore whereas you ſay <hi>p.</hi> 24. though the verdict be given in upon the whole matter, and ſo incloſe Law as well as Fact, yet the binding force of the verdict as to matter of Law, may be derived from the ſanction of the Judges, not from the Iuriſdiction of the Inqueſt: And it may well be
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:56877:182"/>ſuppoſed that the Iurors may err in a matter of Law, in which caſe the Iudges muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the erroneous verdict by a contrary Iudgment, and that Iudgment queſtionleſs ſhall nullifie the erroneous verdict, not the erroneous verdict the Iudgement; whereby it plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appears, That in a verdict upon the whole matter, there is no new Iuriſdiction acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the Iurors in matter of Law, nor left to the Iudges; ſoraſmuch as the Iudgment ſtands good, and obligeth not as it is rendred by the Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, but as it is confirmed by the Iudges. Can a Man that would ſeem ſo Cornucopiouſly learned and wiſe as you do, be ſuch a fool, as to make ſuch a medley of nonſenſe; ſurely<pb n="40" facs="tcp:56877:183"/>ſhould you but tell ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed ſtorie in one of the Inns of Chancerie, the punieſt At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turney there would hiſs you out of his mooting School. What error can be in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of a true ſaying, but in the form there may, and that the Iudges and the Clerks aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to be their office to make in Latin, and ſuch is the form, and Latin they uſually make thereof, that every word, or ſecond are commonly er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous, and that of purpoſe for themſelvs, to make work for themſelvs, by ſpinning the Cauſe in ſuites and vain plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, ſomtimes to ſeven years time, that might have been begun and ended in a day, and by beggering both parties to inrich themſelvs by dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable<pb n="41" facs="tcp:56877:183"/>Fees and extortions, all that while? Can the verdict which is the true ſaying of 12. Men upon the whole matter of Law and Fact, be alter'd by a contrarie Iudgment, (as you expreſsly ſay you can) but that muſt be fals and an untrue ſaying, for what can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to a true ſaying, but a fals? And which of them ought to be altered? you ſay the verdict. Whereupon let all men judg whether you are not a plain liar therein, but ſuppoſe (ſince you goe by ſuppoſitions) that the ſaying of the Iurors is not true, and therefore no verdict, ſuch as Iudges receive, or rather ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, and cauſe to be given them for verdicts by Iurors impanniled by Sheriffs, by<pb n="42" facs="tcp:56877:184"/>Iudges directions for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. Can the Confirmation of a Commiſſary Iudg, by his Iudgment make that good? Its a Maxim in Law, that what is naught in the
<hi>foundation,</hi> can never be made good by <hi>Confirmation:</hi> but I confeſs many an honeſt man is hanged by ſuch ſuppoſed verdicts, and deviliſh Iudgments. Can ſuch Lies be called verdicts, or ſuch Iudgments be called true, more then you can be called a juſt reprover, or a due Cenſurer, that reprove truth, and juſtifie lying? Can the Devill be a worſe Cenſurer or Reprover? What Iudgment (mean you) ſtands good in Mr.
<hi>Lilburnes</hi> Caſe, who had no Iudgment at all paſſed upon him, but that <pb n="43" facs="tcp:56877:184"/>verdict that ſaved him, and the aſſent of the Councell of State, and Parliament that confirmed it? And what ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict or Iudgment do you finde fault with in all your Book over but that? Surely you were in a frenzie when you wove this ſtuff not ſo good as <hi>Linſey Woolſey;</hi> but if you would know what ſhould be done, in caſe a Jury ſhould give in an untrue ſaying, in ſtead of a verdict? (that being made to appear to a Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Judg by the Partie grei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, or his Councell learned to be undeniably true; ſuch a ſeeming verdict, in caſe of life, or land of Free-hold, is traverſable; as alſo any ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict made defective, inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Lawyers as aforeſaid,<pb n="44" facs="tcp:56877:185"/>and thereby ſounding defect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ive in matter, and ſo counted erroneous by them that made it for that purpoſe, to linger the matter for their own gain, as you may read in Mr.

<hi>viz.</hi> to repair his wrong, and pay him treble damages: To for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit their lands and goods to the Lord of the Fee; to have their houſes demoliſhed; their woods rooted; their bodies impriſoned during their lives: And Iurors ought to try At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taints without Fee <hi>Ex officio,</hi> as you may read in the <hi>Mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, p.</hi> 64. And ſo let ſo much ſerve in this place to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form you that the Iuriſdiction of Iurors is to be Iudges and Verdictors of all controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies given them in charge upon their Oaths, as well for mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Law as Fact; and as an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient as, and more permanent then Commiſſary Iudges; for when Commiſſary Iudges had abuſed their places, ſo that<pb n="47" facs="tcp:56877:186"/>they were beaten out of them, and Civill Wars therefore grew between Kings and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple before <hi>Magna Charta:</hi> and ſince, untill the ſaid ſecond agreement made between <hi>Ed.</hi> 1. and them, whereby Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and Sheriffs were reor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained (for they had been or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained before, as appeareth by <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and long before that) to defend the Country when they were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed of their guards, &amp;c. for till then guards continued for the breach of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> begun by <hi>Hugh de Burgo's</hi> means, and then Captains and Leiutenants became She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffs, Coroners, &amp;c. and Centinels, Bailiffs, &amp;c. But alwayes the Free men judged their neighbours conſtantly;<pb n="48" facs="tcp:56877:187"/>And therefore Mr. <hi>Lilburn</hi> neither did, nor could give his Iurors any new Iuriſdiction, nor promote them to any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment more then of right they had, (as you moſt falſly and maliciouſly, however ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norantly accuſe him, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe both him and them to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce the reſt of your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truths which follow, for next you ſay, that thereby you perceiv his Levelling Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy is, that Iudges becauſe they underſtand Law, are to be degraded, and made ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to the Iurors; but the jurors becauſe they underſtand no Law, are to be mounted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loft, where they are to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter Law, to the whole Kingdom: the Iudges becauſe they are commonly gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men

<hi>viz.</hi> Knights or Eſquires to be Juſtices, and Plow men, (which are the beſt kinde of free men in <hi>England</hi>) to be Jurors. And as Jurors are there, and elſwhere the more real Judges, ſo is their calling far antienter, for <hi>ſokmen</hi> were long before Juſtices of Peace in
<hi>England;</hi> And ſoccage was ever a better tenure then
<hi>Eſucage,</hi> or Knights ſervice. But a Juſtice of Peace, and a Plow-man do well together, not onely in Quarter-ſeſſions, but in conſtant houſ-holds; and the eminenteſt, beſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted Knights and Eſquires, as they have ever been the beſt houſ-keepers, ſo they have been the bountifuleſt cheriſhers and countenancers<pb n="94" facs="tcp:56877:210"/>of their Plow-men in their moſt neceſſarie calling for the Worlds ſuſtenance: and have not ſcorned to put their hands to their own plows, as Kings, and Lords have vouchſafed their names, and aſſociacions to their Subjects, in their trades and handicrafts, to countenance, commerce and traffique.</p>

<hi>Contra pacem,</hi> or <hi>Formam Statuti,</hi> as Extortions, and all Frauds, and Injuſtice, don under color of Office and Juſtice, to bee lawful, and as antient as the Common Law of this Land; and more antient too, becauſ ſuch offences were committed before<pb n="2" facs="tcp:56877:225"/>the Laws were written, or made in thoſe caſes, or thought upon, upon, to puniſh the paſt, and prevent the future. By the Law, wee know the ſin that was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it; and by the due courſ of Law, the courſ of ſin ought to bee ſtaied or corrected. But what is this to a debtor, which groweth neither <hi>vi &amp; Armis,</hi> nor <hi>contra Pacem,</hi> nor <hi>contra Formam Statuti?</hi> for recoverie whereof, againſt able debtors, the Statute of
<hi>Weſtminſter</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 18. And the Common Law before that, provided remedies, the proceſs, or proceedings whereof were by ſummons, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment &amp; diſtreſs, (as our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries confeſs) which courſ, if Antiquitie can meliorate, is far antienter then the <hi>Capias</hi> for debt, which they make no elder then the repealed Statute that gave it, 25
<hi>Ed.</hi> 3.17. which the<pb n="3" facs="tcp:56877:225"/>ſame King annulled the 3. and
17. years next after, <hi>viz.</hi> 28. and 42. of his Reign. The delato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſs alleged in the courſ of Summons, is a deceitful infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and an untrue report made to the High Court of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lament; which were it to an inferior Judicature, deſerveth no leſs puniſhment, then the Informers, to bee impriſoned a year, ſilenced for ever, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and ranſomed at the State's pleaſure, <hi>Weſtm.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 29.3 <hi>Ed.</hi> 1. For the truth is, there can bee no ſpeedier waie deviſed, conſidering Actions of Debt by Common Law, and many Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, ought to bee laid in the proper Countie wherein the Defendant dwelleth, and hath, or hath not wherewith to paie; where the Sheriff having his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices, which is the onely proper writ for debt, is a Commiſſion to<pb n="4" facs="tcp:56877:226"/>hold plea above fortie ſhillings, and is to ſummon, attach, and diſtrein, and do execution ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the verdict of the Jurie, if in an Hundred Court, in three weeks, allowing fifteen daies, as Law requireth, between Proceſs and Proceſs; which three weeks between Court and Court, may fully afford, and that is no long delaie, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of what is uſual at <hi>Weſtminſter:</hi> or if in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie Court, three moneths, or twelv weeks doth the ſame. But if the Action bee laid in, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved to the <hi>Common Pleas</hi> at
<hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> (which ought not to bee don, or ſuffered, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out injuſtice, or partialitie, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, not alleged in the Sheriff) they cannot determine the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on under three Terms, which is not the fault of the courſ of Summons, which requireth but<pb n="5" facs="tcp:56877:226"/>fifteen daies between Proceſs and Proceſs; but the fault (more then delatorie) of the courſ at
<hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> which requireth long Vacations between Term and Term, and removeth more Cauſes thither in one Term, or Vacation, then they can end in ſeven.</p>
                  <p>And where they ſaie, Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons are many times fruitleſs; that is never, except the Debtor hath nothing to bee ſummoned by, &amp; ſo ought not by any Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Law, to bee looked after, but with eies of charitie. And why Merchandiſe and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce in this Nation ſhould bee hindered for want of a <hi>Capias,</hi> to arreſt and impriſon non-ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents to death, cannot bee tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly demonſtrated by any Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an reaſon, ſince all men know, that all other Nations as well Heathens, as Chriſtians, who <pb n="6" facs="tcp:56877:227"/>never admitted ſo impious a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie to recover debts, as the <hi>Capias,</hi> finde no hinderance of Trade or Commerce amongſt them, but onely the Trade of Lawyers and Liers, whereof the fewer make the better Common-wealth.</p>
                  <p>That former Parlaments pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided the <hi>Capias</hi> for debts, as a full and moſt neceſſarie remedie for this Common-wealth; and that divers Statutes affirm ſo much, appeareth to bee theſe men's additions to their former miſ-informations, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors, to abuſe this Honorable Parlament: For it was but one Statute that ever provided this <hi>Capias,</hi> and that is long ſince repealed as aforeſaid, and ſo continueth by more then thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie three Parlaments and Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes. Neither doth that Statute ſhew any cauſ for its proviſion,<pb n="7" facs="tcp:56877:227"/>making, beeing, or neceſſitie of its continuance, or hath any Preamble at all (as all neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie Introductions of Law uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have) but pinneth it ſelf to the Statute made for Accompt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, <hi>viz.</hi> Lords, Bailiffs, Rent-gatherers, and ſervants, that cheated their Maſters of their rents, and monies committed to their truſt, to collect and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt for, contrarie to all Laws, Juſtice, Equitie, Mercie, and common honeſtie; all which they falſified, and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their Maſter's monies to their own uſe; which to anſwer unto by due courſ of Law, they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly durſt not abide, for ſhame, more then for the debt, and therefore became Fugitives from their acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance: ſo that the <hi>Capias</hi> was neceſſarie to ſtaie, and fetch them to accompt with their Maſters.<pb n="8" facs="tcp:56877:228"/>But this pinning, or relating this Statute to that, ſeemeth to bee (as Maſter
<hi>Cook</hi> writeth thereof) the work of ſom cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Lawyers, Members of that Parlament, that paſſed it unexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, except by a Committee, which they over-ruled; and that is in a few words, ſo hud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled up amongſt other things, as they might bee as ſoon forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by the hearers, as read by the Impoſtors: which practiſe they have uſed for the unſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable advantage in all Parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that truſted them; God bleſs this from the like, and grant it bee not too late wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Howſoever, that venerable Judge, and Autor of the <hi>Mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of Juſtice, pag.</hi> 283. <hi>ca.</hi> 5.
<hi>ſect.</hi> 7. condemneth this <hi>Capias,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth it to bee contrarie to Law; and ſheweth reaſons therefore, both there, and
<hi>p.</hi> 108.<pb n="9" facs="tcp:56877:228"/>where the Action for accompt is debated, and declared to bee mixt, in regard of the truſt and deceit of the Accomptant, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving therefore to bee proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſo far, as to bee forced to an accompt: but for the debt, more then hee hath wherewith to ſatisfie, the Law requireth nothing of him that hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; and giveth no recoverie, nor other remedie then revenge, which God calleth his own. And both this Author, and the Lord <hi>Coke,</hi> in the <hi>Third part of his Inſtitutes,</hi> agree, that the acting and mainteining of things contrarie to Law, as Law, or lawful, is a ſubverſion of the Law, and that is no leſs then High Treaſon againſt this State and Common-wealth; which caſe is our adverſaries, whom wee hereby impeach thereof, and crave direction and

                  <p n="1">1. Three Bum-Bailies, who by virtue of their

<hi>Capiſes</hi> to catch five times threeſcore perſons without any danger of his own, except by the wrath of God, which few of them
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:56877:229"/>ever feared, but are all embold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by his patience, to attempt the catching of a whole Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lament of moſt wiſe Senators at once, to becom ſubject in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelvs, or their poſterities, to this Purſ-net, perſwading them to father, and maintein this Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtard <hi>Capias,</hi> which knoweth no difference between a Parlament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and another, or between his friend and his foe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In the Art of Ambition, they exceed their Father the Devil, who did but attempt to bee Lord of Hoſts, whilſt theſe men becom Hoſts of Lords, and ſtill covet to enlarge their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In the Art of Murthering, they exceed their brother
<hi>Cain,</hi> who killed but one <hi>Abel</hi> in all his life time, and for that one offence, had the curſ of God upon him and his ſeed for ever;
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:56877:230"/>while theſe men daily murther many of their brethren with falſ Judgments, and ſolace themſelves with Angels, deſile their hands, and fill them with bloud, yet would bee heard in Parlament, when God telleth them hee will not hear them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.15. and bid's them fill up the meaſure of their Fathers, that upon them may com all the righteous bloud of the Earth, from the bloud of <hi>Abel,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Mat.</hi>
23.32.35. and <hi>Luke</hi> 11.50, 51. concluding <hi>v.</hi> 52. <hi>Wo unto you Lawyers, for you have taken away the key of knowledg; you entred not in your ſelves, and them that were entring in, you hindered:</hi> Which Scripture, wee conceiv, may bee fitly applied to our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Lawyers, who have taken away the Engliſh of our Laws, which was the key of our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg therein; And entred not<pb n="13" facs="tcp:56877:230"/>into the truth thereof them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelvs; and them that would, they hindered, until this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie Parlament righted us in that, ſore againſt their wils, and will as wee hope, and they fear, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther right and free us from their bondage, finding that now they have filled the meaſure of their Fathers, that upon them may com, and from them may bee required all the righteous bloud of priſoners for debt, from the bloud of the firſt Free-man of <hi>England,</hi> impriſoned for that cauſ, to the bloud of the laſt that ſhall periſh in priſon for the ſame.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. In the Art of Treaſon, they exceed <hi>Judas,</hi> who with one kiſs, betraied but one Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, to a death fore-ordeined by God's Providence, for the life of the world, except his deſperate betraier, and other un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believer's<pb n="14" facs="tcp:56877:231"/>children of perdition; while theſe men by their daily prevarication, and changing their notes, ſince they have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted the Canonical Organs, and Pſalmiſtical Harmonies, to the tune of the Organical Canons, ſhrill Trumpets, and ratling Drums, ſiding with the ſtrongeſt Faction in Warrs, as with the richeſt partie in Peace, till they have betraied three Common-wealths to manifold deaths, avoidable by the mercie of God, and Praiers of men, except theſe impenitents that harden them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in their wickedneſs, do ſtir up others to ſecond them of ſeditious and implacable ſpirits, ſons of
<hi>Belial.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. In the art of Impoſtors, they exceed the Pope, and
<hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet,</hi> who by their impoſtures endeavored but to counterfeit Chriſt's Miracles, and make thoſe<pb n="15" facs="tcp:56877:231"/>counterfeits ſailable at high rates, thereby to diſeſtimate his truth, and prefer their own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions, and to eclipſ his kingdom of grace, that they might oſtentate themſelves in too of Vain glorie; whilſt theſe men having diſguiſed our Lawes in Forraign languages, made them vendible to our ſelves at their own prices, and thereby have ſubjected the ſeven liberal Sciences, and three free King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom's of ſeveral free Nations, to their unlimitable impudence, which being over-ruled for the language they intend to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and augment in price and juriſdiction, and ſettle them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in one tyrannical Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie, as arbitrarie, as intolerable, and as ſlaviſh, as mercinarie. And contrarie to <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and were ever ſince the Court called the Upper Bench, hath impoſed
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:56877:232"/>its judicature in matters of Debt, and other Common Pleas, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſlie forbidden them, and taken out of their juriſdiction; and both it, and the Common Pleas, impoſe their Judicature in caſes of Tithes, expreſlie taken out of their juriſdiction by ſeveral Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, and given to the ſpiritual Courts, which (though now ſuppreſſed) their juriſdiction ought not to bee reſumed but by the Parlament, nor executed without an Act for that end.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. In the Art of Perjurie; they infinitelie exceed
<hi>Peter,</hi> who forſwore himſelf but once, and when he heard the Cock crow, went out from the Maid that urged him, wept bitterlie, repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him of his ſin, and reſolved to do ſo no more: whilſt theſe men forſwear themſelves dailie; and when they hear their Pockets ring, go in to their Wenches,<pb n="17" facs="tcp:56877:232"/>with whom they interchange deceitful imbraces, and ſeem to laugh merrilie, perſevere in their wickedneſs, and implore a Parlament to countenance, and continue them in condition to do ſo ſtill.</p>
                  <p n="7">7, 8, &amp; 9. In the ſeveral Arts of Extortion. Bribing, and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varication, they exceed the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious Judges, <hi>De'Burgo Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilian, Bremble, Thorpe, &amp;c.</hi> as well in their takings, as in their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; for as thoſe were few to their manie, and <hi>Thorp's</hi> taking was but 100 <abbr>l.</abbr> from manie hands; how manie hundred pounds taketh one of them from one hand? wee can witneſs too well, and others may compute by the increaſ of the price of an <hi>habeas Corpus,</hi> Error, &amp;c. And the neceſſitie of divers parties to make frequent uſes thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, more to avoid Juſtice,<pb n="18" facs="tcp:56877:233"/>then to deſire it: whereby the prevarication, Ambodexterſhip, and Legerdemain of theſe men dailie appeareth more and more by their impairing of their Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents to improve themſelves; manie men of manie thouſands beeing brought ſuddenlie to nothing, and moſt of them from nothing to manie thouſands
<hi>per annum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="10">10. In the Art of Commuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they exceed both Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts, and Civilians, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muted corporal penances to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuniarie, paiable out of perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal eſtates, while theſe men change Treaſons to treſpaſſes, and Treſpaſſes to treaſons at their pleaſure, and make debt guiltie of death, ſurer, though ſomtimes ſlower then Treaſon, or Miſdemeanor whatſoever, and men's eſtates as well real, as perſonal whollie their own.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. In the Art of Transfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation<pb n="19" facs="tcp:56877:233"/>they exceed Chamelions, who can bee of anie colour but white, expreſſed in Scripture to bee the immaculate inveſtiture of Angels: Theſe men can ſeem of all colours to ſuit with all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominations, though never ſo divers, and all contraries, and turn the Law for all their turns, and arrogate moſt truſt when they are moſt treacherous, and face themſelves with the truth of Saints, when they are as falſ as Devils.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. In the Art of Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiting, they exceed both Alchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts, and Coyners, of whom the firſt counterfeit, but Gold, and Silver, and turn more Gold to braſs, and Silver to lead, then Copper to Gold, or Lead to Silver: And the ſecond Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit, but Pictures, whilſt theſe men counterfeit Juſtice, Equitie, and Lawes, more concernable
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:56877:234"/>then Metals, to God and Man; and fix mens ſubſtances, more conſiderable then their pictures, upon themſelvs, and their heirs.</p>
                  <p n="13">13, &amp; 14. In the Arts of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerie, and Fraud, they exceed all Coiners of falſ Monies, and Counterfeiters of Letters, and Tokens; whom, if they catch with ſuch miſdeameanors, they ſomtimes ſeverelie puniſh, and ſomtimes paſs over ſleightlie, or excuſe artificiallie, as may moſt conduce to their profit, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur with their practiſe, whilſt they themſelvs make it a chief part of their office to forge the returns of Sheriffs and Coroners of ſeveral Writs, and to file them for true Records, and due pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of Law; whereupon follow Judgments, Executions, and Impriſonments to manie thouſands, to their utter undo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:56877:234"/>and for want of ſummons, Attachments, and exigents dulie executed, and returned by thoſe Officers who never ſee them, yet are anſwerable by Law for thoſe falſ Returns made unknown to them, and the Forgers thereof, as of all other faudulent deeds which cannot be drawn, ingroſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, antedated, and contrived adviſedlie without them, or ſom of their Counſels, ought to bee puniſhed for the ſame, for which they are never queſtioned; but contracting the greateſt Forge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, wherein they are actors, paſs for good deeds and online thoſe trifles that want their skill, and privitie, are made great, or dear offences.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. In the Art of Lying they exceed the men of
<hi>Creet,</hi> and <hi>Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeba,</hi> who (as is written, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi>
4.22.) were alſo Ancient, as theſe men would be accompted;
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:56877:235"/>for thoſe but as Men and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, lied but to men in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane things, whilſt theſe men, as Devils, lie unto God, and in contempt of his Divine Word, and Deitie, as ſhall appear here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. In the art of Simonie, they exceed <hi>Simon</hi> himſelf, who would have bought, for his monie, the Gifts of the Holie Ghoſt, and intending the Apoſtles fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor, purchaſed their indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: whilſt theſe men have, with their Monie's, purchaſed their Offices, and all the ſaid gifts of the Devil, to execute them, and by the ſame endeavor to acquire the favor of manie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther corrupt members, who (as wee hope) ſhall not bee ſuffered long to abuſe the reſt of this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie Parlament.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. and 18. In the arts of Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitie, and Tenacitie, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

And Heaven wll neither take, nor receiv, anie but God's Elect; nor Hell anie but Reprobates; but Catchpols, Gaolers, and their Gaols catch, and receiv all men they can ſue, and count all too few, and keep them in their pawes, and caves, while they are worth a farthing.</p>
                  <p>And thus having ſuppeditated their Proëm with eighteen de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions of their properties that appropriate to themſelvs all our proprieties, and ſo ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerated their 13 falſ Reaſons for the ſupportation of their innumerable falſities, wee ſhall deſcend to ſift thoſe Reaſons as followeth.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="24" facs="tcp:56877:236"/>1. The firſt is all falſ; for the attaching of perſons ſecureth no part of the Plaintiffs debts by paiment, or other ſatisfaction, but commonly their debtors bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to miſerable deaths, and their eſtates from their heirs and creditors, to Lawyers and Officers: For the proceedings by Summons, wee have anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before. And for Priſoners that are able to give for their libertie ot their Gaolers, they have as much as they deſire and paie for out of their creditors rights; and their own Frie, and not the Plaintiffs, or their heirs, have their Gaoler's leavings.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſecond is like the firſt; for it is not a few, that are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined for debt, when Sir <hi>Jo. Lenthal</hi> hath in his cuſtodie or liſt one thouſand perſons; the Warden of the <hi>Fleet</hi> as many, the Gaols of <hi>London, Weſtminſter,</hi>

No Trade but Lawyers, nor ſuch, but <hi>Weſtmonasterians,</hi> will bee hindered by taking away the <hi>Capias.</hi> It was the lawleſs uſe thereof, that cauſed more Uſurers then Merchants, to look after men's perſons: It ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was, nor could bee the ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dieſt waie for Plaintiffs to gain their debts, but the moſt dela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie to recover, and the moſt readie and uſual to loſe them; ſo as the repetition of the decaie of Trade, if the <hi>Capias</hi> were taken off, is but tantologie for want of reaſon, and an abuſe of Parlament, to bee offered ſuch untruths, to hear, or look<pb n="27" facs="tcp:56877:237"/>upon, puniſhable as aforeſaid.</p>
                  <p n="4">4.

Hee that hath enough, or more then ſufficient to paie his Creditors, of his own eſtate, will neither regard Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, nor fear Arreſt, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire it, beeing ſure of what li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie hee pleaſeth, paying his Gaoler, and to leav what his Gaoler leaveth, to whom hee<pb n="28" facs="tcp:56877:238"/>liſt, as aforeſaid; whereby more Creditors are cheated, then by any other deceit, and more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, then debtors of that kinde, who commonly live too plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and leav ſomthing, when their Creditors have nothing whereby to live, or whereof to leav.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The fifth is as untrue as the reſt; for a debtor that is worth the Summoning, can live no where better then in his Decenarie where hee is beſt known, and hath his pledges anſwerable for his honeſtie; nor can hee tranſfer his eſtate to any other Countie but to his loſs: And his avoiding the due courſ of Law, is a miſdemeanor that depriveth him of the benefit depriveth him of the benefit thereof; which beeing certified by a <hi>Testatum,</hi> a <hi>Capias</hi> of courſ enſueth, to purſue him from Countie to Countie, till hee bee<pb n="29" facs="tcp:56877:238"/>found, or outlawed; which was ever lawful againſt ſuch as waved their Law and freedom, to anſwer it in its due courſ; and ſuch a Certificate of the Sheriff of that Countie whence hee fled, ought to make to the

Compare, and finde as followeth: There the debtors had the mercie to be no Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners at all, but as hired ſervants, and ſojorners: The Juſtice, to bee no bondmen which maſters might uſe at their pleaſures: The ſuſtentation; to have food and raiment enough, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent to their conditions, and their maſters callings: The freedom; to live, and love huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, wives, and children all together; to pray, feed ſheep, and work comfortablie together in their maſters houſes, fields, vineyards, &amp;c. with no leſs good<pb n="45" facs="tcp:56877:246"/>inſtruction, and recreätion to themſelves, then profit and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure their maſters, and hope of full libertie to make uſe of thoſe good inſtruments for their own beſt advange at ſix years end, if a Jubilee freed them no ſooner. Contrariewiſe; here the pooreſt debtor hath the cruelleſt impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment; that is the rule of theſe men's mercie: The greateſt cheater hath the greateſt favor; that is their Juſtice: The ſuſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation wee would buy for our ſelvs at the beſt hand, while our monie laſt's, our Goalers take, or keep from us, to force us to buy half ſo much, and nothing ſo good of them, while wee have a pennie left; and after to ſtarve; when others, for our Cuſtom, would prolong our lives, with truſt for a time, they will truſt no poor man for a farthing; nor rich, but to fetch his monie. Our Freedom is not to the next<pb n="46" facs="tcp:56877:247"/>Ward, nor in our own, to enjoy wives, or children, longer then they bring fees to the Gaoler; that when we have ſold our cloaths, and bed-cloaths to feed our bloud-ſuckers, our common bed is the bare ground, till wee fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh here, and our wives and children in the ſtreets, and dit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, do the like; hope of liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie wee have none, but by ſuch deaths; for our livelihoods are too little to pay our Fees from the dayes of our Arreſts, to our Funeral: if anie attein to liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie by ſome caſualtie, hee is the worſ while hee liveth for his Gaol education. Our Law is derived from the <hi>Romanes,</hi> who (as theſe men ſay) condemned not the Law of the Jewes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Creditors, and Debtors; wee wiſh ours were as merciful; and ſo it was before and ſince <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> when it medled not with men's bodies that had

And how manie are now impriſoned for ſuppoſed debts, which they <pb n="49" facs="tcp:56877:248"/>never ought, or if they did, have paid, or which were not due at the time of the Arreſt, &amp;c. And what neceſſitie of Juſtice was to begin ſuch ſuits? And what murther more wilful, more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, and more cruel, then to impriſon men ſo till they die? And where they ſay, that moſt commonlie debtors have notice before any ſuit be commenced, why then do they debar ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, which is the right proceſs of notice? How come Juſtices of Peace, and Grand Jurie men, that alwaies attend Aſſizes and and Seſſions, to be arreſted by bills of middle Latitats, and Outlawries, before they can hear of anie ſuits againſt them? which caſe is common. And for their alleging of manie Statutes, or Parlaments, that approved of their Capias, let them name one more then that of 25 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3.17. which gave it, and was repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,

It is true, That of 19 <hi>Hen.</hi> 7.9. ordeineth proceſs upon Actions of treſpaſs upon the caſe to bee no more delatorie then that practiſed for debt. And wee grant that actions upon the Caſe, being mixt acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ever ought to have been by Capias before that Statute, however neglected by ſuch as ever left undon thoſe things which they ought to have don, to do thoſe things which they ought not. And that ſummons is a milder way, and not ſo compul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorie: as the Capias, wee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, and hold more Chriſtian; for the Capias compelleth men that are not able to pay their debts, and that never ought anie, to be impriſoned, ſtarved, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered: And no juſt debt to bee paid ſo ſoon as ſummons, all the

                  <p>The 10. is as deceitful an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation as anie before that; for wee deſire no new way upon ſummons, to haſten Judgments before Attachments and diſtreſs, by affidavit of a ſummoner: but that ſummons may go by Writ, as it was wont, to the Sheriff of the Countie wherein the debtor dwelleth, requiring him by good ſummonitors (which are the words of the Writ) to ſummon the partie to bee at the return of the Writ, in the Court whence it iſſued, whether the Sheriff is to return both the writ, and the ſummonitor's names, in that ought to be ſubſtantial free-hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and free pledges of the ſame decenarie as the debtor, who, if they return
<hi>ſummonitus,</hi> are anſwerable for ſo much as they finde him worth, till At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment<pb n="52" facs="tcp:56877:250"/>taketh it into the She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riff's hands, or ſureties for appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. If the return bee a <hi>nihil habet,</hi> then (as aforeſaid) the Law ought to look no further after him, till God make him able: for (as the Proverb was) where nothing was to be had, the King was to looſ his due. And if the return bee <hi>non est inventus,</hi> his ſhunning of the Law maketh him a malefactor, ſubject to a Capias upon a
<hi>Teſtatum</hi> directable to the Sheriff of the Countie wherein he lurketh, and ſo from Countie to Countie, till hee bee taken, or out-lawed. Again, if the return be <hi>ſummonitus,</hi> At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment, diſtreſs, and Judgment follow of courſ, legallie, and ſpeedilie, and are the onlie due proceſs of Law, as wee have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared before; and ſo is not a Judgment by
<hi>nihil dicit,</hi> ſtolne by connivence of Attornies, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to the Defendant, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though<pb n="53" facs="tcp:56877:250"/>his warrant of Attornie bee had to appear for him: a common feat countenanced too much by the Law at
<hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> to thouſands undoings, and their own gain. For trial by Jurie, Iſſues joined, cannot bee tried o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, <hi>Nihil dicits,</hi> &amp; Arreſts by <hi>Capias</hi> uſe them not: For mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplicitie of Suits and Perjuries, they were things never found fault with at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> theſe 200 years, till now. And now if the
<hi>Chancerie</hi> grant Juſticieſes to Sheriffs and Stewards, as they ought, <hi>gratìs;</hi> and Corporations proceed by their Charters,
<hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monaſterians</hi> need not fear to bee troubled with multiplicitie of Suits; and thoſe growing fewer, ſo will their perjuries.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. The eleventh is a toie; for wee grant that a
<hi>Capias ad reſpondend.</hi> beeing unlawful, that <hi>ad ſatisfaciend.</hi> is groundleſs, and both moſt lawleſs, and uſeleſs;<pb n="54" facs="tcp:56877:251"/>the due proceſs of law for debt being as aforeſaid, ſummons, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. The twelfth is a Riddle and a Paradox, wherewith theſe men would amaze us with ſom wonders of their experience hapned by this Common-wealth by the benefit of their <hi>Capias,</hi> which they call the Proceſs of Arreſt, <hi>Anno Domini</hi> 1267, <hi>&amp;</hi> 1350. They might have don well to declare their particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, that others that know them not, might judg thereof as well as themſelvs. Wee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, and they know the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, Impriſonment, Exile, and Hanging of Traitors, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortioners, &amp;c. as were the <hi>Spencers,</hi> Father and Son; the Judges <hi>Hugh d' Burgo, Treſilian,</hi> &amp;c. who ſeduced Kings, as theſe men would Parlament, were beneficial to this Common-wealth; and wee hope it will bee ſo again, though wee know<pb n="55" facs="tcp:56877:251"/>not how long the Devil may help his ſervants: but of poor debtors wee can remember no arreſt that was ever beneficial to any one perſon of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, but have ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proved the Negative.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. Laſtly, for the ſubtilties, and ſubterſuges of debtors, wee know none more then theſe men; and their predeceſſors taught ſuch as grew indebted, and by their natural inclinations, aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with theſe men's advices, and devices, far more ſubtle then their own, to cheat men of their Lands and Eſtates; and by the credits of their ſureties, that took them to be honeſt men, until too late, they found the contrarie. Wee confeſs it is true, that ſuch debtors by the helps of ſuch teachers, became ſo ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, as to get in their hands all they could of their Creditor's rights, and conveied them to<pb n="56" facs="tcp:56877:252"/>what uſes they pleaſed; and procuring themſelvs afterwards to bee arreſted, where they might bee brought, or removed to the upper Bench, or <hi>Fleet;</hi> made thoſe places their ſanctuaries and ſubterfuges, where they are many thouſands in liſt, but few in cuſtodie, riding, rioting, and ſpending their Creditor's and Suretie's Eſtates, ſomtimes at their own doors, who want for their ſakes thoſe bleſſings to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev them, which they vainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to out-brave them; and ſomtimes in parts remote and Forrain, more active againſt this Common-wealth, then for it.</p>

                     <pb n="66" facs="tcp:56877:257"/>in the ſaid Countie, by virtue of a Conveiance derived from a Grant of King <hi>H 8.</hi> in which it is mentioned that the ſaid King gave that Recto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
<hi>(cùm pertinentiis inter alia)</hi> to the then Duke of
<hi>Suffolk,</hi> and his heirs. And becauſ it is there fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mentioned, that the ſaid King gave alſo to the ſaid Duke the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of the Rectorie of <hi>Walmſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate,</hi> which is a Pariſh of it ſelf in another Decenarie, and <hi>Wapentack</hi> of the ſaid Countie, diſtinct from, though neighboring to that of <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel,</hi> and founded by the Lord of the Manor of <hi>Walmſgate,</hi> who then was (as yet the Defendant who clai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth from him, is) Lord of all that Pariſh in Fee-ſimple, and gave the Tithe thereof (as well his own, as his Tenants at will) to the Rector for the time beeing, and his ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors for ever, reſerving to himſelf, and his heirs for ever, the Patronage and Preſentation; ſo that when there hapned a neglect of Preſentation in<pb n="67" facs="tcp:56877:257"/>him, or in his heirs, the right thereof fell by lapſ to the Biſhop of <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coln,</hi> and upon his neglect, to the King; which beeing ſo then, in King <hi>H. 8.</hi> hee might grant for that time to the ſaid Duke: But ſaving for that time, or the like relapſ, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance deſcended to the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant.
